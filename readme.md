# Bigup Forms

**This has been forked from the legacy plugin bigup-contact-form.**

This plugin aims to build upon the reliable PHPMailer plugin and expand the static contact form into
customisable forms of any type built directly in the Gutenberg editor.

#### Goals:

- Build any form type.
- Preconfigured field blocks (name, email, etc) ready to drop-in.
- No input field configuration required.
- Customisable text block to create custom input fields.
- All input field blocks provide their own validation/sanitisation.
